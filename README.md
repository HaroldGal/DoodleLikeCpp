# DoodleLikeCpp
## Implementation of a game largely inspired by Doodle Jump in C++

### Prerequisites

Install SDL library for C++

```
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian
sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
```

### Installing

Just make the executable in the folder src

```
make
```
### Running & Tips

Run the executable in the folder src with

```
./exe
```

Play with your computer keyboard's arrow keys, the difficulty rises with your score.
Press 'w' if you want to cheat and see the hardest difficulty.

### A brief sight

If you don't have the time to install or run the executable (or if you are not on linux), you can have a sight of the game with the images in the folder Exemples.
